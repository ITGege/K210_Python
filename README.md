# K210 
1.#Project description
This repository is a collection of applications for the Kendryte K210 AI chip which include face detection, color detection, object detection and classification, QR code and Apriltag code detection ,and communication with the ArduPilot flight software. Finally, we can deploy these applications to the Uavs terminal and make drones more intelligent.
Before your first try, you should read this README.md and the User's manual carefully.
